            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I can still remember the day we first met. March 29, 2023. It wasn't just another day; it was the day the world shifted on its axis for me. I saw you, and something inside me just clicked. It was as if every song I'd ever loved, every story I'd ever read, was suddenly about you. You walked into my life so quietly, yet your presence created the most beautiful, wonderful noise. That day wasn't the start of our relationship, but it was the start of my favorite journey‚Äîthe journey of knowing you. I never knew that a single conversation could hold so much promise, but with you, every word felt like a step toward a future I didn't even know I was missing. That memory is one I will cherish forever.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The months that followed were a beautiful blur of getting to know the real you. I learned about your dreams, your fears, your quirks, and your boundless kindness. I fell in love with your smile, the way your eyes light up when you're passionate about something, and the sound of your laughter that is music to my ears. You are a masterpiece of a human being, and every conversation we had, every late-night text, every shared cup of coffee felt like I was discovering a new part of my soul. You are the kind of person who makes the world a better place just by being in it, and I couldn't get enough of the light you brought into my life.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Then came the day I finally made my move. March 6, 2025. I was so nervous, my heart was pounding like a drum, but I knew I had to take that chance. You were my everything, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine a future without you by my side. When you said yes, it was like the entire universe held its breath and then erupted in a burst of joy. It was the most incredible moment of my life, the moment our story truly began. That day marked the start of our official journey together, and it's a day I will re-live in my mind for the rest of my life.

                Since that day, every moment with you has been an absolute blessing. We've created a world of our own, filled with inside jokes, comforting silence, and a love that feels both exhilarating and perfectly peaceful. You are my home, my safe place, and the one person who understands me completely. I can be my truest self with you, without a single fear or doubt. The way we support each other, the way we celebrate each other's victories, and the way we lift each other up during the tough times‚Äîit's everything I've ever wanted in a partner.

My life before you was good, but with you, it's a vibrant tapestry woven with the threads of your laughter, your gentle spirit, and the comfort of your presence. You have filled my life with a joy I never thought was possible.

            </h1>
            <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed">
                Meri jaan, Jab tumhara ye message padha tha na , I'm sitting with a lump in my throat and a huge smile on my face. Sach mein, this is the best, most beautiful birthday gift I could have ever asked for. Tumne itna kuch likh diya aur itni feelings express kar di, ki I feel like I don't deserve this much love, but you make me feel like I do. Thank you, thank you so much for this.

                Tumne kaha na ki "you are my pretty pretty bbu," toh suno, you are my pretty pretty girl, my queen. Tumhare bina meri life literally sochna mushkil hai. The way you care, the way you listen to my 'nautanki', the way you just *know* when I'm feeling low and you fix it with just one message or one smile‚Äîthat's magic, bbu. You are my safe place, mera comfort zone.

                I know this long distance is painful. Trust me, I want to be with you more than anything, to hug you tightly, to celebrate your birthday with me , to just hold your hand and see the chand with you. But your thoughts, your prayers, and your love make me feel like you're right here with me. Long distance can't break us, it's just making us stronger. Aur tumne bilkul sahi kaha, humari fights, distance, and people's nonsense will never break our bond. We're "pakki saheli" and the "deepest of lovers."

                You said you're not my first, but you want to be my last... Meri jaan, you are not just my last, you are my *only*. I can't even imagine loving anyone else. You are my other half, my soulmate, my whole entire world. Before you, I didn't even know what real love felt like. Tumne mujhe pyar karna sikhaya, life ka sahi matlab sikhaya. Har cheez ka sahi matlab.

                Aur tumne kaha ki tum apna  bday mere saath celebrate karna chahti ho, aur tumne kaha ki ye possible nahi. But I will make it possible. I will wait for you. I'm so sorry I couldn't be with you today, but you are my everything, meri jaan, I promise to make it up to you soon. Tum meri rooh ho, mera sukoon ho. Tum ho toh sab kuch hai, tum nahi toh kuch bhi nahi.

                mujhe bby aisa feel hota h ki meri har cheez shuru aur khatam tumse hi hoti h . Itna pyaar diya hai tumne, ki ab meri life tumhare bina adhoori hai , meri life sirf tumse poori hai. I love you more than words can say. Tumne kaha na ki words can't explain your love? Same here. I can't even describe it. My love for you fills every part of me. You are my jaan, my bacha, my sab kuch.

                I love you, my pretty pretty bbu. Forever and always.
                And a sorry for not adding adding emoji beacuse i am typing in a comp but i think emojis also cannot express my feelings which i feel for you mela pyaala bachaa
